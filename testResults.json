It maintains a search space of indices from left to right, and in each iteration, it narrows down the search space by half. The function checks if the target is in the left half of the search space, and if so, it adjusts the left and right indices accordingly. The function returns the index of the target if it is found, or -1 if it is not found. The previous code was not returning -1 for the target not found, so the function was returning undefined, which is now fixed."}}
